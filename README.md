# MEL – Machine Expression Language  
**v1.0**  
Human intent → LLM elixir

A lightweight textual syntax that helps turn vague, natural human questions  
into structured, high-quality instructions that large language models understand  
and execute with significantly better consistency, creativity and elegance.

MEL lives entirely inside `*…*` delimiters — making it instantly readable, copy-pasteable  
and model-agnostic.

**Status**: Experimental v1.0 (January 2026)  
**License**: MIT  
**Repository**: https://github.com/polonski/mel

## Quick start (30 seconds)

```text
*As a once-in-a-generation systems thinker*
*Translate this human request into optimal LLM behavior:*
"I want a beautiful data dashboard in React"

*Prioritise poetic clarity and visual rhythm*
*Infuse one non-obvious conceptual improvement*
*Output clean, production-ready code + short explanation*
*Polish until it sparkles*
```
