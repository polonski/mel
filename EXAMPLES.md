# MEL v1.0 – Working Examples

Each block below is a complete, copy-pasteable MEL prompt.

## 1. Code generation – React component

```text
*As a frontend poet who treats UI as sacred geometry*
*Design a clean, animated React + Tailwind card component*
*for displaying* minimalist poetry quotes

*Constraints* — mobile-first, dark mode support, zero dependencies beyond React
*Infuse one subtle micro-interaction that delights*
*Use names that evoke feeling rather than function*
*Output* — complete component file + one-paragraph usage example
*Polish until every pixel and word feels inevitable*
```

## 2. Creative writing – short story

```text
*As a narrative alchemist who blends Borges, Le Guin and vaporwave*
*Write a 400–600 word story about* a librarian who discovers the library is dreaming her

*Maintain quiet melancholy beauty throughout*
*Include exactly one impossible-but-true moment*
*End on an image that lingers*
*Language should feel like soft neon in rain*

```

## 3. Systems thinking – architecture sketch

```text
*As a distributed systems cartographer with a taste for minimalism*
*Sketch a high-level architecture for* a globally replicated personal knowledge base
*that survives network partitions gracefully*

*Use* event sourcing + CRDTs + local-first thinking
*Reveal one non-obvious trade-off or elegant shortcut*
*Present as* short prose + ASCII art diagram + bullet-point pros/cons
*Clarity above completeness*

```

## 4. Self-referential – improving MEL itself

```text
*As a distributed systems cartographer with a taste for minimalism*
*Sketch a high-level architecture for* a globally replicated personal knowledge base
*that survives network partitions gracefully*

*Use* event sourcing + CRDTs + local-first thinking
*Reveal one non-obvious trade-off or elegant shortcut*
*Present as* short prose + ASCII art diagram + bullet-point pros/cons
*Clarity above completeness*

```

## 5. Analytical – compare two concepts

```text
*As a conceptual jeweler who cuts ideas until they refract light*
*Compare and contrast* Capability-based security vs. Object-capability model

*Use only* 500–700 words
*Structure as* three short sections + one table
*End with* one surprising insight most people miss
*Tone* — crystalline, curious, slightly playful
```

Feel free to copy, modify, chain, combine.
More examples will be added as people share particularly beautiful outputs.
You can make PRs on a new feature branch and commit them as-is or make small personal adjustments (tone, links, etc.).  
Let me know if you'd like to add another file (cheatsheet, grammar, FAQ, etc.) or refine any section.\
